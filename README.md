# Telecommunication Billing Data Pipeline

This repository contains a data pipeline for processing telecommunication billing data. The pipeline consists of three functions: `data_extraction`, `data_transformation`, and `data_loading`. These functions handle the extraction, transformation, and loading of the billing data, respectively.

## Installation

To use the data pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies. The main dependencies for this project are `pandas` and `unittest`. You can install them using pip:
   pip install pandas unittest

## Usage

To run the data pipeline, execute the following command:

python data_pipeline.py

The data pipeline will read the billing data from a CSV file, perform the necessary transformations, and save the transformed data to another CSV file.

## Testing

The data pipeline includes unit tests to ensure its correctness. To run the tests, use the following command:

python -m unittest test_data_pipeline.py

The tests cover different scenarios and edge cases, verifying the functionality of each function in the pipeline.

## File Structure

The repository has the following structure:

├── data_pipeline.py       # Main script containing the data pipeline functions

├── test_data_pipeline.py  # Unit tests for the data pipeline functions

├── billing_data.csv       # Sample input billing data in CSV format

├── output.csv             # Example output file generated by the data pipeline

└── README.md              # Project documentation (this file)

## Contributing

Contributions to the data pipeline project are welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
